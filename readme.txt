This is a program which suggests movies to users based on similarities between users. Distance metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan and Lmax distances are used to compute the distances between users. A movie is suggested to a user by finding the highly rated movie of the user’s top few similar users. The dataset used for this program is Movielens and it can be found here http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

To improve the recommendation method, the features such as age of the users is taken and weights are given to it.
